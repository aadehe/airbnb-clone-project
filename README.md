# Project Overview
The Airbnb Application is a comprehensive online booking platform that incorporates essentially many advanced technologies. Due to it's rich modern technology stack, Many institutions including Universities adopt it as a project to train and teach the implementation of different technologies. In line with such projects, this Airbnb Clone is a Comprehensive web application project that aims to recreate the core features of the Airbnb platform. This project is part of a learning experience designed to enhance proficiency in backend web development, object-oriented programming, database design, application security, RESTful API design, and deployment workflows. The project is built entirely from scratch and progresses in multiple phases using a Python web framework, and finally deploying a live version of the platform. The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to design and implement the backend of a simplified Airbnb-like platform. The backend will provide a set of secure, scalable APIs to handle the core functionality of a rental marketplace. Specifically, the backend will support:
1. **User Management** – sign up, login, authentication (JWT/OAuth), and profile management.
2. **Property Listings** – create, update, delete, and retrieve rental listings (with metadata such as location, price, and availability).
3. **Search & Filters** – query listings by location, date range, and price.
4. **Booking System** – allow guests to book listings, check availability, and manage reservations.
5. **Reviews (optional stretch goal)** – guests can leave ratings and reviews for completed stays.
6. **Data Optimization** - Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack
This project focuses on the backend implementation of an Airbnb-like rental platform.
