# Project Overview
The Airbnb Application is a comprehensive online booking platform that incorporates essentially many advanced technologies. Due to it's rich modern technology stack, many institutions including Universities adopt it as a project to train and teach the implementation of different technologies. In line with such projects, this Airbnb Clone is a Comprehensive web application project that aims to recreate the core features of the Airbnb platform. This project is part of a learning experience designed to enhance proficiency in backend web development, object-oriented programming, database design, application security, RESTful API design, and deployment workflows. The project is built entirely from scratch and progresses in multiple phases using a Python web framework, and finally deploying a live version of the platform. The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to design and implement the backend of a simplified Airbnb-like platform. The backend will provide a set of secure, scalable APIs to handle the core functionality of a rental marketplace. Specifically, the backend will support:
1. **User Management** – sign up, login, authentication (JWT/OAuth), and profile management.
2. **Property Listings** – create, update, delete, and retrieve rental listings (with metadata such as location, price, and availability).
3. **Search & Filters** – query listings by location, date range, and price.
4. **Booking System** – allow guests to book listings, check availability, and manage reservations.
5. **Reviews (optional stretch goal)** – guests can leave ratings and reviews for completed stays.
6. **Data Optimization** - Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack
This project focuses on the backend implementation of an Airbnb-like rental platform.
+ **Programming Language:** Python
+ **Framework:** Django | Django REST (Python web frameworks for building and managing RESTFul API respectively )
+ **Database:** PostgreSQL (A relational database for persisting users, listings, and bookings)
+ **ORM / Query Layer:** SQLAlchemy (Python)
+ **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with role-based access (hosts vs guests)
+ **API Design:** RESTful APIs (with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation)
+ **Testing:** Pytest (Python)
+ **Containerization:** Docker (to ensure consistent development and deployment environments)
+ **Version Control & Collaboration:** Git + GitHub
+ **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery (For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.)
+ **Caching & Performance:** Redis (for session management and caching search results)
+ **CI/CD:** CI/CD Pipelines | GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
+ **Deployment:** AWS | GCP | Azure

## Team Roles
Although this is a personal learning project, in a real-world scenario an Airbnb-like backend platform would involve different specialists. To connect the Airbnb Clone backend project to the real-world roles that would typically contribute, using standard definitions, the following team roles have been identified (inspired by sources like [ITRexGroup’s](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/CABRbX2N9OhgSp-TnQCosQ) breakdown of software development team roles).<br>

1. **Backend Developer**<br>
Implements the core business logic of the application. Builds and maintains APIs, handles authentication, and enforces booking rules.
+ **In this project**:
  - Develops REST APIs for user management, listings, and bookings.
  - Implements role-based authentication (guests vs hosts).
  - Enforces booking logic (e.g., preventing double-booking).
 
2. **Database Administrator (DBA)** <br>
Responsible for the Designs, manages, and optimizes the database to ensure data integrity, security, and performance.
+ **In this project**:
  - Designs schemas for Users, Listings, Bookings, and Reviews.
  - Ensures proper indexing for search queries (e.g., by location and date).
  - Manages migrations and data consistency.
 
3. **DevOps Engineer**<br>
Handles deployment, infrastructure, and automation to ensure the backend runs reliably in different environments.
+ **In this project**:
  - Creates Docker containers for consistent development and deployment.
  - Sets up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for testing and deployment.
  - Prepares deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Render).

5. **QA Engineer (Tester)** <br>
Ensures the backend meets functional and non-functional requirements through systematic testing.
+ **In this project**:
  - Writes unit and integration tests for APIs (authentication, listings, bookings).
  - Validates business rules (e.g., price validation, booking overlaps).
  - Performs load testing on search and booking endpoints.

6. **Project Manager (Optional)** <br>
Coordinates tasks, sets timelines, and ensures alignment with goals.
+ **In this project**:
  - Defines milestones (e.g., Phase 1: Auth → Phase 2: Listings → Phase 3: Bookings).
  - Tracks progress in GitHub Issues/Projects.
  - Keeps focus on the learning objectives.
