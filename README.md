# Project Overview
The Airbnb Application is a comprehensive online booking platform that incorporates essentially many advanced technologies. Due to it's rich modern technology stack, many institutions including Universities adopt it as a project to train and teach the implementation of different technologies. In line with such projects, this Airbnb Clone is a Comprehensive web application project that aims to recreate the core features of the Airbnb platform. This project is part of a learning experience designed to enhance proficiency in backend web development, object-oriented programming, database design, application security, RESTful API design, and deployment workflows. The project is built entirely from scratch and progresses in multiple phases using a Python web framework, and finally deploying a live version of the platform. The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to design and implement the backend of a simplified Airbnb-like platform. The backend will provide a set of secure, scalable APIs to handle the core functionality of a rental marketplace. Specifically, the backend will support:
1. **User Management** – sign up, login, authentication (JWT/OAuth), and profile management.
2. **Property Listings** – create, update, delete, and retrieve rental listings (with metadata such as location, price, and availability).
3. **Search & Filters** – query listings by location, date range, and price.
4. **Booking System** – allow guests to book listings, check availability, and manage reservations.
5. **Reviews (optional stretch goal)** – guests can leave ratings and reviews for completed stays.
6. **Data Optimization** - Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Feature Breakdown
The backend for this Airbnb Clone project will include the following core features:

### **1. User Management**
Handles account creation, authentication, and role-based access (guest or host).  
This feature ensures secure login and profile management, while enabling hosts to manage listings and guests to make bookings.  

### **2. Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete rental listings with details such as title, location, price, and availability.  
This feature forms the backbone of the platform by providing the inventory of properties for guests to explore.  

### **3. Booking System**
Enables guests to book properties, check availability, and manage reservations.  
This feature enforces business rules such as preventing double bookings and handling booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled).  

### **4. Reviews**
Lets guests leave ratings and comments about their stay on a property.  
This feature adds trust and transparency to the platform by allowing feedback that helps future guests make informed decisions.  

### **5. Payments**
Processes transactions related to bookings, including payment status (pending, completed, refunded).  
This feature ensures that financial operations are securely tied to bookings, simulating how real-world rental marketplaces handle transactions.  

## API Security
Security is a critical part of this project to ensure that user data, bookings, and payments remain safe.  
The following measures will be implemented:

### **1. Authentication**
All users must log in using secure credentials (e.g., JWT-based authentication).  
This prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only verified users can interact with protected endpoints.  

### **2. Authorization**
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced (e.g., host vs. guest).  
This ensures that users can only perform actions they are allowed to, such as hosts managing properties while guests manage bookings.  

### **3. Data Validation & Sanitization**
All inputs will be validated and sanitized before processing.  
This prevents malicious inputs such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or invalid data from compromising the system.  

### **4. Rate Limiting**
API requests will be throttled to prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks).  
This helps maintain service stability and prevents malicious actors from overwhelming the system.  

### **5. Secure Payments**
Sensitive financial operations will be handled securely, with proper encryption and integration with trusted payment gateways.  
This ensures that transaction data is protected and reduces the risk of fraud.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why Security Matters**  
- **Protecting user data:** Usernames, emails, and booking details must remain private.  
- **Securing payments:** Financial transactions are highly sensitive and must be encrypted.  
- **Preserving trust:** A secure backend ensures users can confidently interact with the platform.  

## CI/CD Pipeline
### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every new code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main branch, while Continuous Development (CD) automates deployment so that the application is always up to date.  

### Why is it important?
- **Faster development cycles**: Automates repetitive tasks so developers can focus on features.  
- **Higher quality**: Automated testing catches bugs early before they reach production.  
- **Consistency**: Ensures the same process is followed for every deployment.  
- **Reliability**: Reduces human error in builds, tests, and releases.  

### Tools to be Used
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating builds, tests, and deployment workflows directly in the repository.  
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application to ensure consistency across environments.  
- **(Optional) Kubernetes**: For orchestrating and scaling containerized deployments.  
- **(Optional) AWS/GCP/Azure**: For hosting the backend and managing cloud infrastructure.
